        <h1>First Week in San Francisco</h1>
        <div class="date">February 2026</div>

        <p>Landed on a Tuesday. Jaka and I had been running 8x from London for three months. The business was working. But London wasn't where we needed to be.</p>

        <p>The thing about SF: people talk about their companies the way athletes talk about training. No hedging. "We're at $300K ARR, need to figure out account management before going upmarket." In London people change the subject. Here someone pulls out their phone to intro you to the person who solved that exact problem.</p>

        <p>The speed is real. Meet someone Monday, warm intro Tuesday, call Wednesday, handshake deal Friday. I've shipped features slower than that.</p>

        <p>The timezone shift has been brutal for our European ops. Account managers in Poland, Bulgaria, Spain are winding down when our day starts. I'm taking calls at 11pm that used to happen at 3pm. But in the first week we talked to three founders who'd scaled creator marketplaces, a fund partner we'd been chasing for months, and a CMO who signed a pilot on the spot.</p>

        <p>Writing code 7am to midnight most days. The platform needs to scale — we're in 10 countries now and the admin tooling I built in November is groaning. Rebuilding creator matching, adding brand analytics, automating payouts for 1,000+ creators.</p>

        <p>A year ago I was writing ML pipelines at Cleo wondering if I'd start something of my own again. Now I'm in San Francisco with a product that works, revenue, and creators posting content across 10 countries every day.</p>

        <p>Time to make it 10x bigger.</p>
