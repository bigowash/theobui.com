        <h1>Closing a Chapter: Two Years of Trippl</h1>
        <div class="date">February 2026</div>

        <p>I closed the chapter on Trippl recently. Two and a half years, a team of seven, a product I built from scratch — and then it was time to move on.</p>

        <p>Trippl started as Get Home Safe. Women shouldn't feel unsafe getting home at night. We built a ride-sharing marketplace matching people on the same route at the same time. I was CTO. I built everything — iOS, Android, dashboard, website, backend.</p>

        <p>The hardest thing about a marketplace: both sides need to show up at the same time. No drivers, riders leave. No riders, drivers leave. Months of chicken-and-egg — subsidized rides, campus ambassadors, student union partnerships. Some worked, most didn't.</p>

        <p>What I actually learned isn't "marketplaces are hard." It's that human coordination is a software problem. When it worked — 200 riders matched on the same night, all arriving and departing on schedule — it was beautiful. The challenge wasn't the algorithm. It was getting hundreds of people to do the same thing at the same time, reliably.</p>

        <p>That insight is the foundation of everything I'm building now at 8x. Different domain — creators instead of riders, content instead of routes — but the same core problem. Coordinate humans across geographies, keep quality consistent, pay them fairly, scale without scaling headcount linearly.</p>

        <p>I was 21 when we started. Never managed anyone. Suddenly running standups, code reviews, roadmap decisions, team conflicts — while trying to ship features. Learned the CTO job is 30% writing code and 70% making sure other people can write code effectively.</p>

        <p>When I decided to step away, I didn't hesitate. Not because I was tired. Because I could see the next thing I wanted to build was bigger, and Trippl wasn't going to get me there.</p>

        <p>Don't regret a day of it. Onto the next one.</p>
