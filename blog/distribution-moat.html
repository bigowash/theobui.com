        <h1>Distribution Is the Only Moat Left</h1>
        <div class="date">February 2026</div>

        <p>Someone with Cursor and Claude can now build in a weekend what used to take five engineers three months. The cost of building software has collapsed. The barrier to shipping is zero.</p>

        <p>So what's left? Getting it in front of people.</p>

        <p>There are thousands of AI apps launching every week. We built a scraper that monitors Product Hunt — 2,300+ B2C apps in the last two years. The products are interchangeable. The ones that win figure out distribution.</p>

        <p>Traditional channels are broken. Facebook CPMs up 30% year over year. Influencer marketing means $10K for one post, hoping the audience overlaps with yours.</p>

        <p>Here's what we figured out: a brand-new TikTok account has roughly the same probability of going viral as one with millions of followers. The algorithm doesn't care about follower count. It cares about watch time and completion rate. New accounts actually get a boost.</p>

        <p>So instead of one influencer, one post — we give brands 30 creators making 300 pieces of content per month. Each one is a shot on goal. With 300 attempts, something hits. Consistently.</p>

        <p>The interesting part as an engineer: the problem isn't building a platform. It's coordinating thousands of people across 10 countries creating content, hitting deadlines, following brand guidelines, getting paid correctly. Human coordination solved with technology. The data we collect on what works, in which markets, with which messaging — that's the moat.</p>

        <p>People ask why I'm not building an AI product. I am. I'm building the system that tells you how to distribute one.</p>
